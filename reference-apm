If you run iRule commands, the system may display erroneous ERR_NOT_FOUND log messages.

This issue occurs when all of the following conditions are met:

Your BIG-IP APM system is configured with a virtual server that uses an access profile.
You have configured the access policy of the access profile with an iRule using the ACCESS::remove command.
Traffic that the access policy processed invokes the iRule to run the ACCESS::remove command.


When you run the iRule command, you may observe log messages similar to the following example in the /var/log/apm file:
err tmm1[<pid>]: 01490514:3: 00000000: Access encountered error: ERR_NOT_FOUND. File: ../modules/hudfilter/access/access.c, 
Function: access_save_init_req_to_sessiondb, Line: 14823


 to match client ip to IP subnets
expr { [IP::addr [mcget {session.user.clientip}] equals "10.0.0.0/8"] || [IP::addr [mcget {session.user.clientip}] equals "172.16.0.0/27"] }


normally you see error message generated for LDAP in session.ldap.last.errmsg (ex: aad2a221.ldap.last.errmsg) it is useful for troubleshooting.
You can also activate "Show Extended Error" in your ldap query.
you will see the error generated by ldap...


expr { [mcget {session.user.version}] == "11" && [string tolower [mcget {session.client.type}]] == "ie" }
